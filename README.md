# Project_4A - Insurance Dashboard
This project prototype aims to present a 'dashboard'' to the user based on their current insurance coverage across multiple products and providers. It also aims to present planning and documentation 'tools' to encourage planning for future events including death (ie. setting up of will), medical decisions (ie. advanced medical directive) and opportunities to buy products (ie. link to direct purchase insurance website).


##Design
The website uses Bootstrap 3.3.7 to give it a modern look-and-feel. 

The colour blue was chosen as part of the design to invoke security, trustworthiness, confidence and friendliness
