        <h3>Synopsis</h3>

        <p>The COVER platform presents a dashboard for users to assess their insurance coverage across multiple products 
            and providers. Users can manage their insurance contract by making claims and cancelling policies. They can 
            also monitor policy payments both as insured and beneficiary.</p> 
        
        <p>The platform includes basic features so users can plan for unexpected events. Key contacts like Power of Attorney and
            Will Executor can be recorded and easily accessed during key events.</p>

        <p>The COVER platform aims to be the trusted one-stop platform for Singaporeans to manage their insurance policies 
            and unexpected events throughout their lifetime.</p>
        
        <br />

        <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> Most Singaporeans have, as part of their citizenship and/or national service obligations, 
                some forms of insurance coverage. These may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Life and personal accident coverage for Fulltime National Service Men, NSmen etc;</li>
                    <li>Health insurance via Medishield Life for Singaporean citizens and Permanent Residents;</li>
                    <li>Disability insurance via Eldershield.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>This is in addition to those provided by their employers and individually bought.</p>

            <p>With a growing middle-class and higher levels of education, Singaporeans have grown 
                financially sophisticated and turn to insurance to meet various needs. However, insurance policies 
                are complicated contracts which are particularly difficult to track in the long term. Furthermore, not all 
                Singaporeans have access to or can afford financial planners to understand their insurance needs. 
                As a result, we observe: </p>    

            <ul>
                <li>Over 8000 unclaimed insurance policies as at Sept 2015. 
                [<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/over-8000-insurance-payouts-in-singapore-unclaimed-but-public-can-now-check-online">Ref</a>].
                </li>
                <li>Singaporeans between the ages 30-49 being under-insured. 
                    [<a href="http://aonbenefitsplus.com/Aon/Articles/Why-are-Singaporeans-under-insured,-or-worst-still">Ref</a>]. </li>
            <li>Insurance scams from <em>authorised</em> agents. 
            [<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/business/ex-aia-agent-pleads-guilty-again-in-insurance-scam-case">Ref</a>]. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> The COVER platform can address these and other problems plaguing the insurance industry by tracking all 
                MAS-approved insurance policies sold to Singaporeans, PR and residents. This is similar to how the 
                Central Depository Fund (CDF) tracks share ownership on SGX transactions. The platform is user-centric, 
                summarising all policies bought based on risk-event (eg. death, critical illness). This is a great starting point
                for financial planners to fact-find instead of trawling through pages of policy documents. Lastly, COVER 
                platform attempts to be transparent by tracking premiums and benefit payments between various parties, 
                thereby reducing the risk of fraud and unclaimed policies. 
            </p>
